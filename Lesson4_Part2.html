      <p><br/>As a new learner of JavaScript, lesson four was my first introduction to the JavaScript programming language. With this lesson, I was able to familiarize myself with the JavaScript syntax and use it alongside Esri’s API to create interactive web applications. 

<br/><br/>My first impression of JavaScript is that it is a challenging language with complex syntax, especially in comparison to Python which has a much simpler, straightforward, and consistent syntax. The difference in syntax and structure between the two languages has made it slightly challenging to transition from one to the other. For example, I found myself attempting to apply the rules and conventions I learned in Python to JavaScript, such as when declaring variables. Since every programming language has its unique syntax and set of rules, it takes time to adapt to the nuances of a new language like JavaScript. But like with any new programming language, it will require consistent practice and patience to become proficient in JavaScript. 

<br/><br/>Understanding the code documentation was also challenging in itself, especially as a new learner. I found that the documentation is written in a way that assumes the reader already has a certain level of knowledge or experience with coding. For those who are just learning, the documentation syntax is not immediately understandable. In addition, navigating through the documentation was sometimes confusing as the website isn't all that user-friendly. 

<br/><br/>A method that has helped me learn and remember new concepts is creating documentation and writing comments within my code. By keeping documentation, I can keep a log of the concepts that I  struggle with, and when I find solutions to these concepts, I can log the the answers in a way that is easily understandable to me. Having my own documentation that I can refer back to and that I can understand has been beneficial. 

<br/><br/>In addition to W3School’s JavaScript tutorial, I also found FreeCodeCamp’s video tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg&t=1814s">Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners</a> to be an excellent resource for learning JavaScript.
